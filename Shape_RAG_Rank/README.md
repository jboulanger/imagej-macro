# Adjacency graph and shape

We define the rank between regions as the distance in the region adjacency graph and report a few shape parameters.

The input is a label image saved as a tif file with an active selection corresponding to the reference cell.

This macro uses MorpholibJ to compute the region adjacency graph (RAG). MorpholibJ can be installed by enabling the update site Help>upate>IJPB-plugins.
