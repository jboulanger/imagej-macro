A custom macro for Fiji [1] was written to measure the recovery speed of the fluorescently labelled coat around moving parasites in the acquired time lapse imaging experiments. In order to simplify the downstream analysis, region of interest were selected in the 3D image sequence centred on a parasite. To obtain the 3D mask of the selected parasite overtime, the channel with the parasite marker is first selected and filtered with a median filter, thresholded and a 3D watershed on the distance transform of the obtained mask is used to separate touching parasites. The centermost label is then tracked overtime looking for the nearest label centroid in subsequent time points. A 1um shell around the detected mask is computed and the mean intensity and a volume ratio of the segmented second channel is measured inside the shell. The intensity profiles are exported to csv files and loaded in a jupyter notebook in order to adjust an exponential recovery model f(x) = a + b * (1 - exp(-(x - c) / d)) * exp(-e * x) to the intensity profile and volume fraction over time. A 95% completion time is then computed from the parameters of th model as 2.99 * d.
